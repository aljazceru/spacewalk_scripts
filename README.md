spacewalk_scripts
=================

Simple script that automates updating xml files from http://cefs.steve-meier.de/ and updates security errata for all channels you configured.

For it to work you have to:
- point SCRIPT_PATH to folder in which you have errata-import.pl script from  http://cefs.steve-meier.de/
- point CFG_FILE to file in which you have set your spacewalk creds
- have a working spacewalk server :)
